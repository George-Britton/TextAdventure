# Welcome to the text adventure template!

## In this project you will find the classes and logic to create your own text adventure.

See what you can do to expand upon and modify what's there to create your very own game!

If you want some jumping off points, have a go at some of these:
- Can you create an enemy for the player to fight?
- How about adding verticality to the map?
- The map-parsing system isn't optimised, can you rework it?
- Why not try and add a smoother inventory?
- If you're more into guided questions, there are a few dotted around the files with the prefix _// QUESTION_

Launch the project by opening TextAdventure.sln in Visual Studio.
The project files to modify are:
- TextAdventure (.h & .cpp)
- Map (.h & .cpp)
- Interface (.h & .cpp)
- Inventory (.h & .cpp)
- Map.csv
Feel free to add new classes and files.
